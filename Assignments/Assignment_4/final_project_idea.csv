For my final project I am thinking about a few things I would like to explore. I would like to  use data for employees under 1099 to predict the taxes they need to pay at the end of the year. I think I would start by gathering incomes of businesses and seeing what the percentage brackets are for taxes, and compare them to what those businesses paid out. I would also have to consider other subjects such as what was written off, or anything else I might be missing. I just am not sure what information I have access to yet.
 If I am unable to find the data I need for that, I would like to gather health related data. Life expectancy of people living in Utah per the different counties. I think I would be able to have access to that information.
